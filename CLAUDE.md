# Code style
- Maintain separation of concerns between UI, service and data components
- Write self-documenting code. Prefer clear naming over excessive commenting
- Create small, atomic UI components for re-usable, dumb presentational components
- A file should contain one type (class, interface etc.). Create separate files for separate types.
